\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In the era of Big Data, humongous amount of data is produced every second from diverse sources such as social networks, sensors, IoT, etc. In majority of use-cases, processing this massive amount of data  is latency sensitive (sub-seconds to minutes), either because of  cost benefits (e.g., every second latency in Google cost \Fix{X}) or the need for a critical action (e.g., detecting attacks and reacting to it).

To address this need, many Stream Processing systems have been developed with the ability of processing huge amount of data on a distributed cluster of machines in a near real-time fashion \Fix{cite}.  


\textbf{Things we achieve in this paper: }

\begin{itemize}
	\item outline the essential building blocks (BB) in stream processing
	\item \textbf{for each BB: }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Definition: } formally define the BB \Fix{Formally?}
		\item \textbf{Purpose: } describe the purpose, importance of it
		\item \textbf{Usecase: } describe the usecase and when it is needed
		\item \textbf{Techniques: } survey the current  and past techniques for that BB
		\item \textbf{Trade-off in techniques: } show the trade-off, pro and con of  each technique
		\item \textbf{Future Direction:} discuss the remaining challenges and potential improvement
	\end{itemize}
	\item the interaction among building blocks.
	\item describe the top-5 most popular current stream processing solutions and the components in each.

\end{itemize}
