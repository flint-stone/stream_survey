\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In the era of Big Data, humongous amount of data is produced every second from diverse sources such as social networks, sensors, IoT, etc. In majority of use-cases, processing this massive amount of data  is latency sensitive (sub-seconds to minutes), either because of  cost benefits (e.g., every second latency in Google cost \Fix{X}) or the need for a critical action (e.g., detecting attacks and reacting to it).

To address this need, many Stream Processing systems have been developed with the ability of processing huge amount of data on a distributed cluster of machines in a near real-time fashion \Fix{cite}.
