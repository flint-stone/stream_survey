\section{Communication Mechanism}
\label{sec:communication}


\noindent\textbf{Definition:} 
operators are distributed on multiple machines, to enable large-scale processing. Therefore there is a need for a communication mechanism, between these operators. 

\noindent \textbf{\\Purpose:} 


\noindent \textbf{\\Properties:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{flow direction:} which direction does data flow. push, pull, or a combination of both, like a pub-sub system
	\item \textbf{buffering: } are there any buffering capabilities. How large is the buffer?
	\item \textbf{re-playability}: can the message be replayed?
	\item \textbf{reliability: }can it handle failures. does is lose data? does it effect its availability?
	\item \textbf{ordering:} is there any guarantess on ordering? total ordering? FIFO?
	\item \textbf{ direct or proxy}: is the communication direct from one machine to another or through a second entity?
\item \textbf{ batch or online: } is the communication done in batches or sent as soon as available?
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{\\Solutions, trade-offs and usecases:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item RPC methods
	\item publish-subscribe through 3rd entity (kafka)
	\item direct pub-sub. -- zeroMQ
	\Fix{TODO: and study this in more detail}
	
\end{itemize}



\noindent \textbf{\\Future Direction:}
