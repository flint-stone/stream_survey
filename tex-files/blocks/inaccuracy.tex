\section{Accuracy: Handling late and out-of-order messages}

\noindent\textbf{Definition \& Purpose:} 
out of order and late messages are the norm.  even when using a ordered communication mechanism, there time could be event time instead of message time stamp. We need mechanism to fix inaccuracies This is one of the main motivations of having a lambda architecture with batch in parallel.

\noindent \textbf{\\Properties:}
Any other approaches than dataflow?
How does Borealis do this? 


No mechanism
Relying on parallel batch pipeline (Lambda)
Rewind and replay
Delaying for seeing more data ?


Talk about event time and so on?
