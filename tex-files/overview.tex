\section{Stream Processing and its Building blocks}

\subsection{Background}

\begin{itemize}
	\item basic definitions of stream processing. 
	\item what is operator
	\item how do messages flow
	\item how operators are connected
	\item  ...
\end{itemize}


\subsection{High Level Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item describe the main building blocks. These are in Table \ref{table:blocks}
	\item discuss the definition, purpose, importance of each block.	
\end{itemize}


\begin{table}[h]
	%\centering
	\tbl{Essential building blocks in Stream Processing Engines.	\label{table:blocks}}{
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}%
			\hline
			\rowcolor[HTML]{E0E0E0} 
			\bfseries Building Block & \bfseries Purpose  % specify table head
			\csvreader[head to column names]{tables/building-blocks.csv}{}% use head of csv as column names
			{\\\hline\csvcoli&\csvcolii}% specify your coloumns here
			\\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
	}
\end{table}


\Fix{Do we want to argue we are covering all essential building blocks??? or just say the most important ones?}


\Fix{We can talk about the API here? or even in the background section?}

\Fix{Should we break resource management into elasticity, load balancing, and placement. Then make resource management a layer instead?}

\Fix{do we need the reprocessing component?}

\subsection{Interaction Among Building Blocks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Draw a figure of the building blocks and their interaction. 
	\item Talk about how the influence each other
	\item Maybe try to break them down into a layers? with some being in a touching-all layer?
\end{itemize}
